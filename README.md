# MNIST-simple-classifier

MNIST is dataset of handwritten digits.
It is project of simple digits classifier. 
num_classes = 10 (from 0 to 9).

I haven't GPU that is why i start only 10 epoch with two type of neuronal network:
* MPL - multilayer perceptron layer neural network.


* CNN - convolutional neural network
